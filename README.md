# BetterUp iOS Engineer Interview Project

Thanks again for your interest in the position!  We are excited to dive into the fun part of the interview process!

Our goal is to focus conversations on real code instead of whiteboard logic puzzles.


## Your mission... if you choose to accept it...

Build a "News Feed" application for iPhone using Swift.

### Example mockups

NOTE: This mockup is intended as a starting point. Feel free to dazzle us with your creativity!

## Core features (Focus on what matters)

- **Delightful** interactions with emphasis on transitions or animations where possible
- **Intuitive** user experience and interaction design consistent with modern iOS platform patterns
- **Maintainable** code, consistent architectural patterns, and organized view layout

## Anti-Features

- **Persistence to disk is not required.** Assume all data will reset between app launches.
- **No interaction with a web API.** RESTful networking fundamentals are critical for this role but are not part of this project.
- **Sticking to core iOS frameworks is not required.** Feel free to use any third-party libraries but be prepared to provide justification.

## Functional Requirements

This repository contains a skeleton Xcode project including:

- An `articles.json` file with serialized article data to be displayed in the app
    - _Please use this data file as the source of articles data for the project_
- A bare-bones `Article` model struct with all the properties represented in the JSON objects

_As a user, I want to_...

- **View a list** of the provided news articles
- **View only my favorite** news articles
- **Open the contents** of an article on the web
- **Mark my favorite articles** so I can save them for quick access later

⚠️ The only firm implementation-level requirement is that **you may not use interface builder to create the UI**. All view creation and layout must be done in code. ⚠️
